"""Windows handoff lane workflow validation data.

This lane module holds the digest of the one reviewed handoff workflow, which
runs the source-free scanner and synthetic tree tests. It is imported statically
by the shared policy module, which dispatches to it through a fixed registry. It
must not import the shared policy module.

Lane interface, identical in every lane module:

WORKFLOW_TEMPLATES maps a workflow kind to its exact expected text.
WORKFLOW_SHA256 maps a workflow kind to the expected SHA-256 of its text.
CANDIDATE_WORKFLOWS lists, in order, the path, workflow kind and size-failure
code that the candidate checker validates when the pool is platform.
